# Deploy Secure OpenVSCode Server to Render with OAuth

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:
* a [Render](https://render.com/) account
* an account with the [OAuth Provider](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/docs/configuration/oauth_provider) of your choice.

## Set up provider account

Consult the [OAuth2-Proxy Provider Configuration Documentation](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/docs/configuration/oauth_provider/), and select at least one provider to use for authenticating users of Open VSCode. Create an OAuth application with your provider of choice. For the Homepage/Base URI, enter a placeholder like `https:openvscode-secure-server.onrender.com`, and for the Callback/Redirect URI, enter a placeholder like `https:openvscode-secure-server.onrender.com/oauth2/callback`. You will update the OAuth2 app with your URIs once your OAuth2-Proxy Server deployment is complete. Save the Client Secret and ID in a secure place like a password manager for later reference.


## Set up Open VSCode Server

To deploy Open VSCode to Render as a private service, click the following button and follow the instructions:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/render-examples/openvscode-private-server)

After that, create a name for the service group (for example `Private OpenVSCode Server`) and click <kbd>Apply</kbd>.

## Start the server

Render starts the server automatically. Copy the service address to the clipboard:

## Set up OAuth2-Proxy server

Fork the [OAuth2-Proxy Render Example Repository](https://github.com/dnilasor/oauth2-proxy). In the Render Dashboard, select <kbd>YAML</kbd> from the side navigation and click the <kbd>New From YAML</kbd> button:

After that, use your connected GitHub account or the full URL of your public OAuth-Proxy fork to create a deployment based on the fork.

## Configure OAuth server

Create a name for the service group (for example, `Secure Access To Open VSCode`). Next, enter the environment variable values to configure OAuth.

- For `OAUTH2_PROXY_UPSTREAMS` enter the Service Address for Private Open VSCode Server appended by http://
- For `OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID` enter the Client ID from your OAuth App
- For `OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET` enter the Client Secret from your OAuth App or password manager
- For `OAUTH2_PROXY_PROVIDER` enter the name of your OAuth provider
